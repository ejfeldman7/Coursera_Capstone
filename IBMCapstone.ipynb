    "# Introduction\n",
    "## 1.1: Background\n",
    "As we have increased the number of drivers on the road over the course of the last century we have also seen an unfortunate increase in the number of accidents. As car manufacturers and city planners have worked diligently to not only decrease the likelihood of accidents but also the resultant severity of accidents when they do unforunately occur, there is still work to be done to better predict the occurence and level of severity. \n",

    "## 1.2 Business Use Case\n",
    "In this project we seek to answer a question on the behalf of the Seattle Department of Transportation and the drivers of the city of Seattle regarding car accident severity. Namely, we want to be able to predict if accident severity, in particular if an accident results in soley damage to property or personal injury, based on the conditions of the road and the lighting at the time of the accident. If we can answer this question well enough, can we use it to change our education of drivers or send alerts during particularly treacherous conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "## 2.1 Data Sources\n",
    "For the purposes of this project we are [using a dataset](https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf \"Dataset\") of all accidents recorded in Seattle by the Seattle Police Department from 2004 to present. We have isolated only the data pertaining to road conditions based on factors such as rain, standing water, mud, oil, or other factors and those for lighting conditions based on time of day and street lights. We have coded our severity scores as either accidents that result in damage to property or those that also include injury to those in any vehicle involved. \n",
    "## 2.2 Data Cleaning\n",
    "In order to apply our models, we have taken on a few challenges found in the data. First, we have dropped any accidents from the record that do not include information regarding any of the above categories or have them listed as \"Other\" or \"Unknown.\" We have then coded all of the road conditions and lighting conditions as values in order to implement our models. Perhaps most importantly, we noticed that the initial dataset is very heavily imbalanced on our target toward accidents that result in property damage. This imbalance is not the result of improper sampling and should not be ignored, as it points to the truth that most accidents do not result in injuries to passengers, but still may result in costly damage for drivers. We do not want this imbalance to cause our models to simply always predict the less severe case, so we have chosen to downsample the accidents with property damage to represent a set of the same size as the accidents with personal injury. In this way, our models can analyze for structure between the target and the feature set, and not get tricked by the imbalance of real outcomes in our target."
